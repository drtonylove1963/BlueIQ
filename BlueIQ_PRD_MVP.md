## 1. Goal, Objective, and Context

*   **Goal:**
    To establish BlueIQ as a comprehensive, enterprise-grade, and highly extensible .NET-based framework that empowers organizations to rapidly design, build, deploy, and manage sophisticated, event-driven, and workflow-centric business applications and integration solutions, fostering agility, scalability, and operational excellence.

*   **Objective:**
    *   Provide a robust, pluggable workflow engine inspired by SSIS, enabling visual design, scheduling, and monitoring of complex business processes.
    *   Offer a comprehensive plugin management system for modular development, lifecycle management, and secure integration of custom and third-party functionalities.
    *   Implement a resilient core event system supporting asynchronous communication and diverse messaging providers to facilitate decoupled architectures.
    *   Deliver a flexible data layer abstraction allowing integration with various data storage technologies while promoting clean architecture principles.
    *   Establish a hybrid configuration management system for centralized control and dynamic updates of application settings.
    *   Furnish a suite of essential middleware services (AuthN/AuthZ, Logging/Monitoring, Caching, API Gateway) to accelerate development and ensure operational readiness.
    *   Enable seamless integration with a wide array of enterprise technologies and systems (e.g., databases, message queues, ERPs, CRMs) through a rich connector/adapter ecosystem.
    *   Provide intuitive user interfaces (Admin Panel, Workflow Designer) for efficient system administration, development, and operational oversight.

*   **Context:**
    Modern enterprises face increasing pressure to digitize operations, integrate disparate systems, and respond rapidly to changing market demands. Developing custom solutions that are scalable, maintainable, and secure often involves significant repetitive effort in building foundational components like workflow orchestration, event handling, plugin architectures, and operational tooling. BlueIQ addresses this challenge by providing a standardized, feature-rich framework that abstracts common complexities, allowing development teams to focus on delivering unique business value rather than reinventing core infrastructure. It aims to reduce development time, improve solution quality, and provide a consistent operational model for a wide range of enterprise applications, from internal process automation to complex system integrations.

## 10. Initial Architect Prompt for BlueIQ Framework MVP

**To:** Fred (Architect Agent)
**From:** John (Product Manager Agent)
**Date:** June 5, 2025
**Subject:** Request for Technical Architecture Document - BlueIQ Framework MVP

**1. Introduction & Product Vision:**

Fred, we have completed the Product Requirements Document (PRD) for the Minimum Viable Product (MVP) of the BlueIQ Framework. This document outlines the product's goals, functional and non-functional requirements, user interaction design goals, key technical assumptions, and MVP scope.

*   **Core Goal:** BlueIQ aims to be a comprehensive, enterprise-grade, .NET-based framework empowering organizations to rapidly design, build, deploy, and manage sophisticated, event-driven, workflow-centric business applications and integration solutions.
*   **Key Value Proposition:** Reduce development time, improve solution quality, and provide a consistent operational model by abstracting common complexities in enterprise application development.

**2. Key Sections of the PRD for Your Review:**

Please thoroughly review the full PRD. Pay special attention to:

*   **Section 1: Goal, Objective, and Context**
*   **Section 2: Functional Requirements (MVP)** (Visual Workflow Designer is key)
*   **Section 3: Non-Functional Requirements (MVP)**
*   **Section 4: User Interaction and Design Goals** (Blazor UIs)
*   **Section 5: Technical Assumptions** (CRITICAL: .NET 8, Blazor, SQL Server, RabbitMQ, Polyrepo, Microservices)
*   **Section 6: Epic Overview & User Stories (MVP)**
*   **Section 7: Out of Scope (for MVP)**

**3. Architect's Mandate & Key Deliverables:**

Your primary task is to produce a comprehensive **Technical Architecture Document (TAD)** for the BlueIQ Framework MVP. This document should:

*   **Define the overall system architecture (Microservices):** Detail each microservice (responsibilities, API contracts, data models, tech), inter-service communication, service discovery, load balancing, configuration.
*   **Detail the Polyrepo structure:** Propose initial repositories, contents, inter-repo dependency strategy.
*   **Specify the database design (SQL Server):** Schema for core needs, migration strategy, plugin data management.
*   **Elaborate on the frontend architecture (Blazor):** Structure for Admin Panel & Workflow Designer, backend interaction, state management.
*   **Detail core component implementation:** Workflow Engine, Plugin Management, Event System.
*   **Address NFRs:** How architecture meets performance, security, reliability NFRs.
*   **Define testing strategy further:** Unit, integration, E2E test implementation.
*   **Deployment Strategy (Conceptual MVP):** Basic deployment approach for dev/test.
*   **Provide clear diagrams:** Component, sequence, deployment.

**4. Key Questions to Address in the TAD:**

*   How will Polyrepo be managed for build, versioning, deployment?
*   Specific microservices, boundaries, APIs?
*   Secure inter-service communication?
*   Blazor frontend interaction with backend microservices?
*   Visual workflow design translation, storage, execution?
*   Plugin data and migration handling?
*   Data consistency across microservices?

We look forward to your detailed Technical Architecture Document. Please raise any questions or ambiguities you find in the PRD.
