## 1. Goal, Objective, and Context

*   **Goal:**
    To establish BlueIQ as a comprehensive, enterprise-grade, and highly extensible .NET-based framework that empowers organizations to rapidly design, build, deploy, and manage sophisticated, event-driven, and workflow-centric business applications and integration solutions, fostering agility, scalability, and operational excellence.

*   **Objective:**
    *   Provide a robust, pluggable workflow engine inspired by SSIS, enabling visual design, scheduling, and monitoring of complex business processes.
    *   Offer a comprehensive plugin management system for modular development, lifecycle management, and secure integration of custom and third-party functionalities.
    *   Implement a resilient core event system supporting asynchronous communication and diverse messaging providers to facilitate decoupled architectures.
    *   Deliver a flexible data layer abstraction allowing integration with various data storage technologies while promoting clean architecture principles.
    *   Establish a hybrid configuration management system for centralized control and dynamic updates of application settings.
    *   Furnish a suite of essential middleware services (AuthN/AuthZ, Logging/Monitoring, Caching, API Gateway) to accelerate development and ensure operational readiness.
    *   Enable seamless integration with a wide array of enterprise technologies and systems (e.g., databases, message queues, ERPs, CRMs) through a rich connector/adapter ecosystem.
    *   Provide intuitive user interfaces (Admin Panel, Workflow Designer) for efficient system administration, development, and operational oversight.

*   **Context:**
    Modern enterprises face increasing pressure to digitize operations, integrate disparate systems, and respond rapidly to changing market demands. Developing custom solutions that are scalable, maintainable, and secure often involves significant repetitive effort in building foundational components like workflow orchestration, event handling, plugin architectures, and operational tooling. BlueIQ addresses this challenge by providing a standardized, feature-rich framework that abstracts common complexities, allowing development teams to focus on delivering unique business value rather than reinventing core infrastructure. It aims to reduce development time, improve solution quality, and provide a consistent operational model for a wide range of enterprise applications, from internal process automation to complex system integrations.

## 2. Functional Requirements (MVP)

The Minimum Viable Product (MVP) for the BlueIQ Framework will deliver the following core functionalities:

*   **2.1 Pluggable Workflow Engine (Core):**
    *   2.1.1 Ability to define workflows consisting of a sequence of executable steps (plugins).
    *   2.1.2 Runtime execution of defined workflows.
    *   2.1.3 Basic scheduling capabilities for initiating workflows (e.g., time-based triggers).
    *   2.1.4 Persistence of workflow instance state to allow for basic monitoring and recovery.
    *   2.1.5 API for programmatic interaction with the workflow engine (e.g., start workflow, query status).
*   **2.2 Plugin Management System (Core):**
    *   2.2.1 Ability to discover and load .NET-based plugins at runtime.
    *   2.2.2 Basic plugin lifecycle management (load, unload - if feasible for MVP, enable, disable).
    *   2.2.3 Secure mechanism for plugins to register their capabilities and be invoked by the workflow engine or event system.
    *   2.2.4 Basic versioning support for plugins.
*   **2.3 Core Event System (Core):**
    *   2.3.1 Ability for components and plugins to publish events.
    *   2.3.2 Ability for components and plugins to subscribe to specific events.
    *   2.3.3 Support for at least one message broker for asynchronous event delivery (e.g., RabbitMQ as a default, or an in-memory option for simplicity if RabbitMQ setup is too complex for MVP).
    *   2.3.4 Basic event catalog for discovering available event types.
*   **2.4 Data Layer Abstraction (Core):**
    *   2.4.1 Define core interfaces (e.g., Repository pattern) for data access.
    *   2.4.2 Provide an initial implementation for at least one relational database (e.g., PostgreSQL or SQL Server) using a common ORM (e.g., Entity Framework Core).
    *   2.4.3 Mechanism for plugins to define and manage their own data schemas/models through the abstraction.
*   **2.5 Hybrid Configuration Management (Core):**
    *   2.5.1 Ability to load framework and plugin configurations from local files (e.g., `appsettings.json`).
