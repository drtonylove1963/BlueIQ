## BlueIQ Framework - Consolidated Feature Outline (Revised)

### 1. Core Architectural Pillars
*   **Plugin-Based Extensibility:** Design the framework around a robust plugin architecture allowing for modular feature extension.
    *   *(Architectural approach: Plugins will be implemented as independent microservices to ensure isolation, independent scalability, and seamless upgrades.)*
*   **Clean Architecture Principles:** Adhere to Clean Architecture, likely incorporating Domain-Driven Design (DDD) and Command Query Responsibility Segregation (CQRS).
*   **Multi-Provider Support & Orchestrated Migration:**
    *   Enable application microservices to be written against abstracted data access and messaging interfaces.
    *   Provide "connector" plugins for various underlying data storage (SQL, NoSQL, Graph) and messaging systems.
    *   Offer a framework within BlueIQ to orchestrate and manage the process of migrating a microservice from one underlying provider to another (e.g., SQL Server to PostgreSQL). This includes:
        *   Hooks for integrating with external/custom schema translation and data synchronization tools/scripts.
        *   Automated steps for reconfiguring the application microservice and managing the cutover process.
        *   Mechanisms to monitor and manage the migration workflow, aiming for minimal service interruption.
*   **Scalability & Enterprise-Grade Design:**
    *   Design all components (core and plugin microservices) for **horizontal scaling** to handle enterprise-level loads and complexity.
    *   Implement robust **rate limiting** mechanisms to protect services and ensure fair usage.
    *   Incorporate other enterprise-grade considerations such as high availability, fault tolerance, and strategies for managing large data volumes.
*   **Separation of Read/Write Concerns (CQRS):**
    *   Mandate the use of CQRS in all plugin microservices to optimize read and write paths.
    *   Employ the **Outbox Pattern** within microservices to ensure atomic updates to the write model and reliable publishing of domain events/messages.
    *   Utilize the **Saga Pattern** for orchestrating distributed transactions and maintaining eventual consistency across multiple microservices when a business process spans them.
    *   Each microservice will be responsible for its own read models, which can be implemented using various techniques appropriate for its chosen data store (e.g., denormalized tables, materialized/indexed views where supported, or projections into dedicated read databases/caches), updated in response to domain events.
*   **Distributed Data Consistency:** Prioritize eventual consistency for distributed operations, primarily achieved via the Saga pattern (as detailed under CQRS), with robust mechanisms for handling failures and ensuring reliable message/event delivery.

        *   Acts as a lightweight container, providing common services to hosted UI plugins, such as unified navigation, user profile management, and a notification system.
    *   **UI Plugin Integration:**
        *   Supports hosting both full SPAs and smaller, composable UI components/widgets.
        *   Employs a **Web Component-based architecture** for integrating and isolating UI plugins within the shell, promoting modularity and interoperability.
    *   **Communication Model:**
        *   UI plugins primarily communicate with their respective backend microservices.
        *   Provides mechanisms for UI plugins to interact with BlueIQ core services or the shell itself when necessary (e.g., for authentication context, notifications, shared user preferences).
    *   **Key Shell Features:**
        *   **Unified Authentication & Single Sign-On (SSO):** Ensures users log in once to access all integrated UI plugins and applications.
        *   **Consistent Navigation:** Provides a common navigation structure (e.g., sidebar, top menu) for easy access to different modules and applications.
